# HRNautilus
Cura plugin for Nautilus printer

The current file structure is essentially setup as Ultimaker wants the file structure for submission to the marketplace. We strongly recommend you download the plugin from the Cura marketplace as this will streamline the process for everyone.

If you wish to manually install for any reason, a properly packaged release can be found at https://github.com/HydraResearchLLC/HRNautilus/releases
