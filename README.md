# Nautilus
Cura plugin for Nautilus printer

The current file structure is essentially setup as Ultimaker wants the file structure for submission to the marketplace, not installation as a package. We strongly recommend you download the plugin from the Cura marketplace as this will streamline the process for everyone.
# The Plugin is currently available in the marketplace

The printer should work just fine, but some of the profiles are not tuned perfectly
If you wish to manually install for any reason, a properly packaged release can be found at https://github.com/HydraResearchLLC/Nautilus/releases

# Installation Instructions

-Navigate to https://github.com/HydraResearchLLC/Nautilus/releases and download the latest version (the plugin is compatible with both 3.6 and 4.0)

-Open Cura 3.6 or later (it is not a bad idea to have a separate install of Cura for the Nautilus if you already use Cura for other printers, especially while we're still in development)

-Drag and drop the downloaded .curapackage onto the open Cura window.

-Quit Cura and relaunch to complete the installation.

-The Nautilus will now appear in the add a printer menu. Plugin settings can be found in the Extensions dropdown in the top menu bar

-Duet connections are integrated into the plugin so you can connect to the Nautilus under the Extension -> Nautilus Connections menu
