# Nautilus
Cura plugin for Nautilus printer

The current file structure is essentially setup as Ultimaker wants the file structure for submission to the marketplace, not installation as a package. We strongly recommend you download the plugin from the Cura marketplace as this will streamline the process for everyone.
# The Plugin is NOT currently available in the marketplace

If you wish to manually install for any reason, a properly packaged release can be found at https://github.com/HydraResearchLLC/Nautilus/releases

# Installation Instructions
NOTE! If you have been using our pervious cura configuration files (0.4.3 or earlier) you must reinstall Cura to make sure all previous files are deleted from the program files.

-Navigate to https://github.com/HydraResearchLLC/Nautilus/releases and download the version appropriate to your version of Cura (0.1.0 for Cura 3.6 and 0.2.0 for Cura 4.0)

-Open Cura 3.6 or later (it is not a bad idea to have a separate install of Cura for the Nautilus if you already use Cura for other printers)

-Drag and drop the downloaded .curapackage onto the open Cura window.

-Quite Cura and relaunch to complete the installation.

-The Nautilus will now appear in the add a printer menu. Plugin settings can be found in the Extensions dropdown in the top menu bar

-Duet connections are integrated into the plugin so you can connect to the Nautilus under the Extension -> Nautilus Connections menu
